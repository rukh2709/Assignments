    "Answer 1: The main difference between a t-test and a z-test is the assumptions they make about the population variance. A t-test assumes that the population variance is unknown and must be estimated from the sample data, whereas a z-test assumes that the population variance is known. As a result, a t-test is more appropriate when the sample size is small and the population variance is unknown, while a z-test is more appropriate when the sample size is large and the population variance is known.\n",
