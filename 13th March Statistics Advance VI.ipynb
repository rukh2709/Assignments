    "Violation of independence: This occurs when there is a correlation between the observations within each group. For example, if the observations in one group are related to the observations in another group, this violates the assumption of independence. For instance, suppose we are comparing the weight of fruits grown in two different regions. If we take the weight of two fruits from each tree grown in the same tree, then the assumption of independence would be violated.\n",

    "Violation of normality: This occurs when the data within each group is not normally distributed.

For instance, suppose we are comparing the average daily commute times for three different cities.
