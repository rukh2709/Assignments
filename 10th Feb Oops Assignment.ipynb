    "There are 6 access modes in python.\n",

    "Explanation:\n",
    "Read Only (‘r’) : Open text file for reading. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exists, raises the I/O error. This is also the default mode in which a file is opened.\n",
    "Read and Write (‘r+’): Open the file for reading and writing. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. Raises I/O error if the file does not exist.\n",
    "Write Only (‘w’) : Open the file for writing. For the existing files, the data is truncated and over-written. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. Creates the file if the file does not exist.\n",

    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "Answer 2: The close() function closes an open file. We should always close our files, in some cases, due to buffering, changes made to a file may not show until we close the file.\n",
    "It is important to close a file after reading from or writing to it because open files consume system resources, such as memory and file descriptors. If you don't close a file, the system resources that were allocated to it will not be freed up, and this can lead to resource leaks and other problems."

    "Q5. Explain why with statement is used with open(). What is the advantage of using with statement and\n",
    "open() together?\n",
    "Answer 5: \n",
    "The with statement in Python is used with the open() function to handle file I/O operations. It provides a convenient and safe way to open, read from, and write to files.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use open() to access a file, the file remains open until you explicitly close it using the close() method. If you forget to close the file, or an error occurs before you can close it, the file remains open and can cause problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The with statement automatically takes care of closing the file once it is no longer needed, even if an error occurs while the file is being processed. This helps to avoid resource leaks, file corruption, and other problems that can result from leaving files open for too long.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the with statement with open() also ensures that the file is properly opened in the appropriate mode (e.g. read mode, write mode, binary mode, etc.), and that the file is available only within the scope of the with block. Once the with block is exited, the file is automatically closed and any resources associated with it are freed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, using the with statement with open() is considered best practice for working with files in Python, and can help to improve the safety and reliability of your code."
