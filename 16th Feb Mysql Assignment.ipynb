    "Answer 1: A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It is designed to store, retrieve, and manage large amounts of information efficiently and effectively. A database is typically organized into tables, which contain columns that define the data types and rows that store the actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of databases that have different approaches to data storage and retrieval. Here are the key differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structure:\n",
    "SQL databases are table-based, with fixed columns and rows. Data is organized into tables with defined relationships between them. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are document-based, key-value stores, or graph databases. They allow for more flexible and unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Querying language:\n",
    "As the name implies, SQL databases use SQL as the primary language for querying data. SQL is a standardized language for relational databases, which makes it easy to learn and use across different systems. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, use a variety of different querying languages, depending on the type of database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability:\n",
    "SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning they require a more powerful server to handle increased traffic or data. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, meaning they can easily handle increased traffic by distributing data across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema:\n",
    "SQL databases have a pre-defined schema that must be followed to ensure data consistency. NoSQL databases do not have a fixed schema, and data can be added or removed without affecting the rest of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases are best suited for applications that require structured data and transactions, while NoSQL databases are better for applications that require more flexibility and scalability, with less emphasis on transactions and data consistency."

    "Answer 2: DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a set of SQL commands used to define and manage the structure of a database. DDL commands are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and views. Here's a brief explanation of some common DDL commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE:\n",
    "The CREATE command is used to create new database objects, such as tables, views, and indexes. For example, the following SQL code creates a table named \"employees\" with columns for ID, name, and department:\n",

    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",

    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER:\n",
    "The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as a table or a view. For example, the following SQL code adds a new column to the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD salary INT;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE:\n",
    "The TRUNCATE command is used to delete all the data in a table, but not the table itself. It is faster than using the DELETE command because it doesn't log individual row deletions. For example, the following SQL code truncates the \"employees\" table:\n",

    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;"

    "Answer 4: DQL stands for Data Query Language, which is a set of SQL commands used to query and retrieve data from a database.

    "A Primary Key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. It is used to ensure that each row in a table is uniquely identifiable and to enforce data integrity. A Primary Key column cannot have null values and must be unique. It is often used as a reference in other tables as a Foreign Key. For example, in a table of employees, the \"ID\" column could be the Primary Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Foreign Key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the Primary Key column(s) of another table. It is used to establish a relationship between two tables, allowing data from one table to be linked to data in another table. A Foreign Key column can have null values and its values must match the values of the Primary Key in the referenced table. For example, in a table of orders, the \"employee_id\" column could be a Foreign Key that refers to the \"ID\" column in the table of employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key is often referred to as a parent-child relationship. The Primary Key in the parent table is referenced in the Foreign Key column of the child table. This relationship ensures data consistency and integrity by preventing the insertion of data that violates referential integrity constraints."
